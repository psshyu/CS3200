 Compiling and Running
***********************

*
Open up main.m in the functions directory and hit 'run'; this will run all of the matlab files associated with all 3 questions of the assignment.

Questions 1 does not require any 3rd party functions. There are output plots from when I tried varying the intial values of x inside the output directory.

Question 2 is split into 2 parts: q2_1.m has the substitution method where x2 is eliminated and solved as 1 equation. q2_2.m utilizes fsolve to try and solve the question; please ensure that fsolver.m is in the same directory as q2_2.m!

Questions 3 does not require any functions. To see the output where I drew my conclusions from, please see the table 'T' in the workspace.
